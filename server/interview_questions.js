//Node.js
//Definition - Node.js is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment
//             for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser.
//             Node.js uses an event driven non-blocking I/O model.
//Advantages of using node.js
//1. Open source 
//2. Multi-Platform support
//3. Wide Support through NPM(Node package manager) Library - https://www.npmjs.com/

//Data types:
//There are mainly two custom data types used in node.js:
//1. Arrays
//2. Objects

//Node Architecture:
//JS runtime has several components,
//1. Execution/Call stack
//2. Web API container
//3. Callback Queue
//4. Event Loop

//Basic Routing
//req.url - It will always contain the full path of the client request
//Routing - All client requests are not same, we should respond differently 
//           based on the requested url path

//Dynamic Response:
//Endpoint that accepts arguments via query parameters

//File Serving
//core modules in Node.js - http, querystring, fs

//Express.js:
//Fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js
//Express is a replacement for the core http module.
//The major difference between http and express is routing.
//Express comes with a built in router!

//Instead of http module use express to do the following,
//1. Text
//2. json
//3. Querystring
//4. file serving
//5. Not found - give a try
